The use of the ThorLabs CCS100 spectrometer originally came about due to the lack of a useable spectrum analyser and for a while was our only means of finding and confirming atomic absorption lines. Despite this however, we were able to subsequently test it in order to ascertain how well it could be used to measure and study the natural doppler shift in the solar radiation. 

Potential improvements relate to the use of doppler spectroscopy, which has implications in the field of the discovery of exoplanets. In conjunction with looking for perturbations caused by the motion of planets around their parent stars, high-resolution doppler spectroscopy can allow greater amounts of data to be obtained such as the atmospheric composition, which can give us clues to the habitability of such planets. Using a network of lots of small spectrometers that have a lower performance but are much cheaper can offer a better result than fewer more powerful but extremely expensive spectrometers - it was the feasibility of such a setup that we sought to investigate.


It is clear from the measurements that we took that the instrument has sufficient resolution to see the finer details in the solar spectrum, with the sodium absorption line at 589nm and α/β/γ-Balmer lines clearly visible in the data.

However there are significant shortcomings with the large amount of instrumental noise in the data that cannot be easily removed by averaging a number of separate exposures; which has the potential to mask finer features, especially at lower intensities.

In addition, there is little (if any control) available to the user in the supplied software to manually adjust the gain of the spectrometer. This is an issue since the natural variability of the sky brightness changes due to clouds etc. can cause images to be easily underexposed or saturated, which reduces the quality of the data – intermittent issues also resulted from hot pixels that would randomly appear. Even on an apparently clear day, intensities varied unpredictably, requiring manual adjustment of the integration time to prevent saturation. This is an issue that may be overcome through a custom script however it is unknown at this point if this is possible since it may be a technical rather than software limitation.


The CCS100 in short is sufficient to provide a simple spectral analysis of the sun, however in its current form it would be unsuitable for the application, primarily due to the presence of noise but also the overall lack of control available to the end-user. Our suggestion would be to construct a similar device using a sourced CCD, prism and diffraction grating to provide an in-house solution that can be directly controlled with a chosen interface and operating system to provide the greatest amount of functionality.
