The first tasks of the week included refining the magnetic models that we had started making at the end of the first week. We also confirmed the materials involved to ensure that we were confident that a reasonable magnetic field could be achieved before taking the plans down to the workshop for manufacture.

Given the previous difficulties in determining the potassium absorption line with the CCDSPEC, we thought that the situation may be improved by increasing the temperature of the vapour cell since this will cause a broadening of the absorption line. The temperature controller provided could only heat the ovens surrounding the cell to 45°C, whilst the centre of the cell only attained around 32°C. By connecting the ovens to a variable power supply we were able to achieve a cell temperature of over 50°C. Despite this, we were still unable to find any absorption line using the fine tuning of the laser. At this point we feared the issue was us being incompetent, so we called up our technical supervisor; when he was unable to find it either , he suggested that either the coarse tuning of the laser had changed or the vapour cell didn’t contain the right element!

Making fine adjustments to the coarse tuning of the laser is very difficult, and without a high-resolution spectrometer it would be much like trying to find a needle in a haystack. We therefore decided that it would be more sensible to try and prove the composition of the vapour in the cell. To do this we shone a broad-spectrum light source (tungsten lamp) through the cell and into the CCDSPEC. The presence of a particular element can be identified through the location of any clear absorption lines in the detected spectrum. We began to suspect that the CCDSPEC offered insufficient resolution to make such features visible.

We were able to obtain a spectrometer with higher resolution, but which was limited by a maximum wavelength of 700nm. With this spectrometer we were able to disprove the presence of Sodium in the cell, which has visible absorption lines (think of an orange street light bulb), but also show how this technique could be replicated if we had equipment ranging into the near-IR wavelengths.

With further progress in the project reliant on the use of a higher resolution spectrometer, we made enquiries with the Cold Atoms group in the department in the hope we could borrow some equipment. As an alternative method, there was the option for an infrared version of the spectrometer used to test for sodium to be purchased. Unfortunately, scientific equipment comes with a hefty price tag and so if we were to have any chance of getting one, it would be necessary to write a short document to convince the department to purchase one. How successful that will be remains to be seen...
