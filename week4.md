Good news from week 4! 
Considering the past 3 weeks of the summer placement, this week has been both luckier and busier.

At the end of week 3, we have collected some sunlight in order to calculate radial velocity. We spent most of the week 4 by analysing the useful solar data and to get the solar spectra out of them. Since our first set of data collection turned out to be noisy, we were not able to see some of the absorption lines (e.g Sodium at ~589nm) on the constructed spectra. Hence, we went to collect some more sunlight for a short time in order to check we can get less noisy data this time. The second data set collected was much better than the first one. The constructed spectra were showing the absorption lines much more clearly than the first spectra. You can see pictures below for comparison.

We also made a combined plot showing the combination of multiple numbers of spectra to see how do they differ with respect to time. We aim to use the mean spectrum to calculate the wavelength shift between our and the official solar spectrum rest wavelengths. The difference of noisie level between first and second data set can be seen from the pictures below.

How are we going to calculate the velocity?
Via coding, we aimed to create an observer (in our case observer is us on the roof!)  and the sun position at a certain time which we can then calculate the relative distance between them. Hence, the change of distance with respect to time will give us the velocity that we are looking for. We aimed to get more progress on that during the upcoming weeks.

Moreover, we also have good news from the laser errors! Since our technical supervisor was away for a while, we were not able to fix the problems with the lasers by ourselves. However, he is back now and thankfully he took care of the laser and moreover he also fixed the spectrum analyser that was not working since the first day of the summer placement! Now, we should be able to use all of our equipment and successfully observe the potassium absorption line on the spectrum analyser.
