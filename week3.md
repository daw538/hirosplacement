## Week 3
We are now half way through our 6 week project, but are still experiencing a lot of problems! 

The first task of the week was to prepare a case for the purchase of a new spectrometer (CCS175) that has a more suitable range than the CCS100. In the document, we discussed the breakage of old equipment and justified how the usage of the CCS175 will help us for the rest of the project. Also, we included price comparisons from different manufacturersâ€™ spectrometers to show we made the most reasonable choice.

While waiting for replies from Cold Atoms group within the Physics Department on the possible borrowing of a new spectrometer, we focused on some blog writing that hopefully you currently enjoy reading it.

Later in the week, we decided to attempt the fine adjustment of the laser that we were previously reluctant to adjust without being absolutely necessary! We estimated that changing the coarse tuning by 0.5nm increments would be sufficient and since a half turn of the course is equivalent to 6nm, we needed to rotate by 1/24th of a revolution each time. Although this was quite tricky, by sticking a clock-face around the adjustment screw (see picture below) we successfully moved the coarse for 0.5nm increments by using an allen key.

The x and y-axes represent the voltage (V) and the current (mA) respectively. After each increment, we moved along the x-axis (from minimum to maximum voltage offset), with the hope that a gaussian absorption line will appear along one of the scans. However, after moving the coarse by 8.5nm the laser controller displayed an  error message accompanied by a buzzing noise. After seeing the error message we noticed the laser current started to misbehave as we adjusted the axis voltage. Hence, we decided to not to continue using the equipment  until speaking to our technical supervisor for advice. 

After the concerning error messages on our equipment, we decided to do something completely different to our main project while waiting to finalise if we can use the laser again.
Our alternative approach  was to collect some sunlight by pointing an optical fibre directly at the sun and capturing successive one second  exposures through the spectrometer we had previously tested with the tungsten lamp in the previous week. In the meantime, we had some fun by using our solar telescope to observe the sun! With the collected data, we can use the solar spectrum to calculate the radial velocity measurements for the surface of the sun. If we can achieve sufficient precision measurement with a single fibre-fed spectrometer, combining several numbers of them (~150-200) can achieve a precision similar to expensive HiROS telescopes. Therefore, for the following weeks of the project, we will check if that theory can be justified.
